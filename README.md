### Project Description

This project is a website that suggests attire based on the weather. It makes a call to the [OpenWeather](https://home.openweathermap.org/myservices) API for various weather data using coordinates as input. Features include React JavaScript XML (JSX) using Vite to enable convenient and efficient development.
[MORE FEATURES COMING SOON]

### Description of Technologies

#### **_React and JSX_**

React JSX allows writing HTML markup inside JavaScript (JS) files to create components. JSX is more concise and mantainable compared to class-based or other function-based paradigms which separate markup from JS.

#### **_Vite_**

Vite is an alternative to tools like [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) and [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/): JS bundlers. Vite is particularly useful for large, complex projects and features faster server startup times, and faster page-update times in development.
