* style form to design
  - fonts
  - miscellaneous
* enable night weather css for WeatherCard
***** add Esc event listener when opening modals and remove it when closing them
* add event listener to the cards that open the ItemModal when they are clicked...
***** do media queries
***** figure out how to send data to ItemModal from ItemCard

COMPLETED TASKS
* SOLVED: added event.stopPropagation() to child element
    there is something weird with the clicking on the modals. Sometimes when they are clicked, inside, the close-modal function runs. Maybe this is related to event bubbling.
