***** do media queries

COMPLETED TASKS
* SOLVED: added event.stopPropagation() to child element
    there is something weird with the clicking on the modals. Sometimes when they are clicked, inside, the close-modal function runs. Maybe this is related to event bubbling.

* SOLVED: added event listeners
  ***** add Esc event listener when opening modals and remove it when closing them
    * add event listener to the cards that open the ItemModal when they are clicked...

* SOLVED: created hooks for each state(name, link, weather), and set them on card-clicked
  ***** figure out how to send data to ItemModal from ItemCard
